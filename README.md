# Interactive Music Programming Interface

## Overview
An interactive web application that combines music and programming, allowing users to experiment with sound synthesis, audio manipulation, and visual representations of sound waves. This project demonstrates the relationship between mathematical concepts and music through hands-on digital tools.

## Features

### 1. Sound Synthesizer
- Interactive oscillator with frequency range: 20Hz - 9000Hz
- Multiple waveform options:
  - Sine wave
  - Cosine wave
  - Triangle wave (tangent approximation)
- Real-time waveform mixing
- Amplitude control for each wave component
- Intuitive play/stop controls

### 2. Audio Effect Processor
- Audio file upload and processing
- Real-time frequency modulation
- Trigonometric function modulators:
  - Sine modulation
  - Cosine modulation
  - Tangent modulation
  - Custom combination mode
- Dynamic parameter adjustment

### 3. Visual Wave Display
- Real-time waveform visualization
- Responsive design
- Interactive background animation
- Dynamic color schemes

## Technology Stack
